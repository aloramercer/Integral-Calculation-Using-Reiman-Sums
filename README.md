# NumericalIntegrationProject

This project is an implementation of numerical integration methods for calculating the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x^3 + 4x over a specified interval. It uses Left Hand Rule, Right Hand Rule, and Midpoint Rule to estimate the integral. The program prompts the user to input the interval endpoints and the number of subintervals, then calculates and displays the results for each method.

## Features:
- Left Hand Rule integration
- Right Hand Rule integration
- Midpoint Rule integration
- User input for interval endpoints and number of subintervals
- Tabular display of results for each subinterval

## How to Use:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter the interval endpoints (a and b) and the number of subintervals (n).
4. View the integration results for each method in the console.

## Requirements:
- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ library
